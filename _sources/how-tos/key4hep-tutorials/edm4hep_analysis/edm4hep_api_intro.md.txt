# EDM4hep - The common event data model

EDM4hep is the common and shared Event Data Model (EDM) of the Key4hep project.
Here we will give a brief introduction to EDM4hep as well as some of the
technicalities behind it. We will also guide you towards documentation and try
to give you the knowledge to make sense of it.

## Important resources

- EDM4hep doxygen API reference page: [edm4hep.web.cern.ch](https://edm4hep.web.cern.ch)
- EDM4hep github repository: [github.com/key4hep/EDM4hep](https://github.com/key4hep/EDM4hep)
- podio github repository: [github.com/AIDASoft/podio](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio)

## Doxygen API documentation

We start with having a look at the [EDM4hep doxygen API reference
page](https://edm4hep.web.cern.ch):

### The overview diagram
![](images/edm4hep_doxygen.png)

You see a diagrammatic overview of EDM4hep with all the available data types,
broadly organized into different categories. The arrows depict two ways data
types can be related / associated with each other 

- ["Relations"](#relations) (black arrows)
- ["Associations"](#associations) (purple-ish arrows)

#### Relations
These are relations defined within the data types, and which are directly
accessible from the data types. They come in two flavors, depending on the
multiplicity of the relation

- `OneToOneRelations` 
- `OneToManyRelations` 

Data types can relate to other instances of the same type (e.g. `MCParticle`s
usually form a hierarchy of mothers/daughters). Relations are directed, i.e. it
is possible to go from one object to a related object, but vice versa this does
usually not hold. For example, a `ReconstructedParticle` can point to multiple
`Tracks` or `Clusters`, but those do not point to a `ReconstructedParticle`.

#### Associations
These are relations that are in a sense "external" to the data model definition.
They are currently mainly used to connect MC and RECO information, as a direct
link via a relation is not desirable as it would mix the two worlds. In contrast
to relations, associations are not directed, i.e. it is possible to access both
involved objects from the association.

### The table of available types
Just below the diagram is an overview table of all the types that are defined in
EDM4hep. Here they are organized into

- `Components` - very simple types, that are used throughout the
- `Datatypes` - The data types that are defined in EDM4hep
- `Association` - The available associations between different data types

![](images/doxygen_type_table.png)

Clicking on any of these links will take you to the
[`edm4hep.yaml`](https://github.com/key4hep/EDM4hep/blob/master/edm4hep.yaml)
definition file of EDM4hep, jumping directly to the definition of the respective
datatype or component. For more information on this file check out the section
about [podio](#podio-the-technical-infrastructure-on-which-things-run). In
principle it is possible to have *very educated guesses* on how the interface of
the classes will look like from this.

### Navigating the doxygen reference page
To see all the available classes simply click on [`Classes -> Class
Index`](https://edm4hep.web.cern.ch/classes.html) or on [`Classes -> Class
List`](https://edm4hep.web.cern.ch/annotated.html). Doing the latter and
expanding the `edm4hep` namespace gives you something like this

![](images/doxygen_class_list.png)

Clicking on any of the links in this list will take you to the reference page
for that class, e.g. for the [`ReconstructedParticle`](https://edm4hep.web.cern.ch/classedm4hep_1_1_reconstructed_particle.html)

![](images/doxygen_reco_particle.png)

#### Why are there so many classes and do I need all of them?
If you look at the list you will realize there are many classes that are all
named very similar, e.g.

- **`CaloHitContribution`**
- **`CaloHitContributionCollection`**
- `CaloHitContributionCollectionData`
- `CaloHitContributionCollectionIterator`
- `CaloHitContributionData`
- `CaloHitContributionMutableCollectionIterator`
- `CaloHitContributionObj`
- `CaloHitContributionSIOBlock`
- **`MutableCaloHitContribution`**

From all of these classes **only the ones marked bold are truly "visible" and
intended for use**. The others are internal classes or simple helper types that
you will most likely only ever see in compiler errors, especially if you follow
the *Almost Always Auto* style of writing c++ code (see [Herb Sutter's original
blog
post](https://herbsutter.com/2013/08/12/gotw-94-solution-aaa-style-almost-always-auto/)
or [a slightly easier to digest
summary](http://cginternals.github.io/guidelines/articles/almost-always-auto/)).
To understand why these classes exist and what their purpose is, we have to make
a slight detour to
[podio](#podio-the-technical-infrastructure-on-which-things-run).


### Some utility functionality
EDM4hep also brings a bit of utility functionality. You can find it in the
[`edm4hep::utils`
namespace](https://edm4hep.web.cern.ch/namespaceedm4hep_1_1utils.html) (click on
`Namespaces -> Namespace List`, then expand the `edm4hep` namespace and then
click on `utils` to arrive at this link).

# podio - The technical infrastructure on which things run
podio is an EDM toolkit that is used by and developed further in the Key4hep
context. The main purpose is to have an efficiently implemented, thread safe EDM
starting from a high level description. For more (gory) details have a look at
the [github repository](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio).

Here we will describe the code generation, and its implications for EDM4hep. A
[bit further down](#the-podioframe-container) we will describe how to read and
write podio (root) files and the [`podio-dump`](#podio-dump) tool to inspect
files without having to open them.

## podio code generation
The podio code generator is a python script that reads in the EDM definition in
**yaml** format, does a few basic validation checks on the definition, and then
generates all the necessary code via the Jinja2 template engine.

 ![]()<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/key4hep/key4hep-tutorials/4b0cb1387169538c3580ab953c7bb179e42a8470/edm4hep_analysis/images/podio_generate.svg" width="320">

The generated code should (among other things)

- be efficient,
- offer an easy to use interface,
- offer performant I/O.

Having automated code generation has a few advantages:

- Freeing the user from the repetitive task of implementing all the types
  themselves
- Freeing the user from having to deal with all the details of how to do things
  efficiently
- Making it very easy to roll out improved implementations (or bug fixes) via
  simply regenerating the code

### The three layers of podio
To achieve the goals stated above podio favors composition over inheritance and
uses **plain-old-data (POD)** types wherever possible. To achieve this podio
employs a layered design, which makes it possible to have an efficient memory
layout and performant I/O implementation, while still offering an easy to use
interface

![]()<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/key4hep/key4hep-tutorials/4b0cb1387169538c3580ab953c7bb179e42a8470/edm4hep_analysis/images/podio_layers.png" width="320">

- The *User Layer* is the top most layer and it **offers the full
  functionality** and is the **only layer with which users interact directly**.
  It consists mainly of the collections and lightweight handle classes, i.e.
  - `XYZCollection`
  - `XYZ`
  - `MutableXYZ`
- The *Object Layer* consists of the `XYZObj` classes, that take care of all
  resource management and which also enable the relations between different
  objects.
- The *POD Layer* at the very bottom is where all the actual data lives in
  simple `XYZData` POD structs. These are the things that are actually stored
  in, e.g. root files that are written by podio.
  
### Basics of generated code - value semantics
The generated c++ code offers so called *value semantics*. The exact details of
what this actually means are not very important, the main point **is that you
can treat all objects as values and you don't have to worry about inefficient
copies or managing resources:**

```cpp
auto recos = edm4hep::ReconstructedParticleCollection();

// ... fill, e.g. via
auto p = recos.create();
// or via
auto p2 = edm4hep::ReconstructedParticle();
recos.push_back(p2); 

// Loop over a collection
for (auto reco : recos) {
  auto vtx = reco.getStartVertex();
  // do something with the vertex
  
  // loop over related tracks
  for (auto track : reco.getTracks()) {
    // do something with this track
  }
}
```

This looks very similar to the equivalent python code (if you squint a bit, and ignore the `auto`s, `;` and `{}` ;) )

```python
recos = edm4hep.ReconstructedParticleCollection()

# ... fill, e.g. via
p = recos.create()
# or via
p2 = edm4hep.ReconstructedParticle()
recos.push_back(p2)

# Loop over a collection
for reco in recos:
  vtx = reco.getStartVertex()
  # do something with the vertex
  
  # loop over related tracks
  for track in reco.getTracks():
    # do something with the tracks
```

The python interface is functionally equivalent to the one c++ interface, since
that is implemented via PyROOT. There are some additions that make the python
interface more *pythonic*, e.g. `len(recos)` is equivalent to `recos.size()`.
Nevertheless, the doxygen reference is valid for both interfaces.

### Guessing the interface from the yaml definition
Since all code is generated, it is usually pretty straight forward to guess how
the interface will look like just from looking at the definition in the yaml
file. For EDM4hep the general rule is to get a `Member` variable, a
`OneToOneRelation`, a `OneToManyRelation` or a `VectorMember` is to **simply
stick a `get` in front of the name in the yaml file and to capitalize the first
letter.**, e.g.

```yaml
Members:
  - edm4hep::Vector3f momentum // the momentum in [GeV]
```
will turn into something like
```cpp
const edm4hep::Vector3f& getMomentum() const;
```

Similar, but in slightly more nuanced rules apply for the methods that are
generated for setting a value. For `Member` variables and `OneToOneRelation`s
the general rule is to **stick a `set` in front of the name in the yaml file and
to capitalize the first letter**, e.g. (continuing from above)

```cpp
void setMomentum(edm4hep::Vector3f value);
```

For the `OneToManyRelation`s and `VectorMember`s the rule is to **stick a
`addTo` in front of the name in the yaml file and to capitalize the first
letter**, e.g.

```yaml
OneToManyRelation:
  - MCParticle daughters // the daughters of this particle
```

will be generated to

```cpp
void addToDaughters(MCParticle daughter);
```

### Why is there a `XYZ` and a `MutableXYX`?

The underlying technical reasons are rather complex, dive quite deepish into c++
nuances, and definitely far beyond the scope of this tutorial. In short: We need
two different handle classes in order to control whether users are allowed to
modify things or not. As one of the main goals of podio generated EDMs is to be
thread safe the default generated class for each data type allows only for
immutable read access, i.e. it provides only the `get` methods. Only the
`Mutable` classes actually have the `set` methods, and can hence be used to
actually modify objects. The most important implication of this is the
following: **Everything that you read from file, or that you get from the Gaudi
TES (in [gaudi](../gaudi/README.md#accessing-data-within-an-algorithm), or that
you get from a [`Frame`](#the-podioframe-container)) is immutable.** I.e. there
is no way for you to change or update the values that you read. The only way to
"update" values (or collections) is to actually copy the contents and then store
the updated values back. Independent copies of objects can be obtained with the
`clone` method.

### Writing function interfaces
The `Mutable` objects implicitly convert to an instance of a default class.
Hence, **always use the default classes when specifying function interfaces**
(obviously this only works if you only need read access in the function. **There
is no implicit conversion from the default, immutable objects to the `Mutable`
objects!**

As an example
```cpp
void printE(edm4hep::MCParticle particle) {
  std::cout << particle.getEnergy() << '\n';
}

void printEMutable(edm4hep::MutableMCParticle particle) {
  std::cout << particle.getEnergy() << '\n';
}

int main() {
  auto mutP = edm4hep::MutableMCParticle();
  p.setEnergy(3.14);
  
  printE(mutP);  // Works due to implicit conversion
  printEMutable(mutP);  // Obviously also works
  
  // Now we create an immutable object
  auto P = edm4hep::MCParticle();
  
  printE(P);  // Obviously works
  printEMutable(P);  // BREAKS: No conversion from default to Mutable

  return 0;
}
```

### Subset collections
Similar to LCIO, podio generated EDMs offer a *subset collection functionality*.
This allows to create collections of objects, that are actually part of another
collection, e.g. to simply collect all the muons that are present in a larger
collection of reconstructed particles:

![]()<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/key4hep/key4hep-tutorials/4b0cb1387169538c3580ab953c7bb179e42a8470/edm4hep_analysis/images/podio_subset_collections.svg" width="200">

To create a subset collection, simply do
```cpp
auto muons = edm4hep::ReconstructedParticleCollection();
muons.setSubsetCollection();

// You can now add objects that are part 
// of another collection to this one via push_back
muons.push_back(recos[0]);
```

Reading a subset collection works exactly the same as reading a normal
collection. This is handled in a transparent way, such that you usually don't
even realize that you are operating on a subset collection.

## The `podio::Frame` container

The `podio::Frame` is a *generalized event*. It is a container that aggregates
all relevant data (and some meta data). It also defines an implicit *interval of
validity* (but that is less relevant for this tutorial). It provides a thread
safe interface for data access
- Immutable read access only for collections that are stored inside the a
  `Frame`
- All data that is inside a `Frame` is owned by it, and this is also reflected
  in its interface.
  
![]()<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/key4hep/key4hep-tutorials/4b0cb1387169538c3580ab953c7bb179e42a8470/edm4hep_analysis/images/frame_concept.svg" width="300">
  
Here we will just briefly introduce the main functionality, for more details see
the [documentation in
podio](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio/blob/master/doc/frame.md).

### Getting collections from a `Frame`
Assuming that `event` is a `podio::Frame` in the following code examples,
getting a collection can be done via (c++)

```cpp 
auto& mcParticles = event.get<edm4hep::MCParticleCollection>("MCParticles"); 
```

or (python)

```python 
mcParticles = event.get("MCParticles")
```

This retrieves the collection that is stored under the name `MCParticles` with
type `edm4hep::MCParticleCollection`. If no such collection exists, it will
simply return an empty collection of the desired type. As you can see, the type
is automatically inferred in python. **Note that `get` returns a const&, so it
is required to actually put the `&` behind `auto` in c++**, otherwise there will
be a compilation error complaining about a copy-constructor being marked
`delete`.

### Putting a collection into a `Frame`
When putting a collection into a `Frame` you give up ownership of this
collection. To signal this to the users, it is necessary to *move* the
collection into a `Frame`. Again assuming `event` is a `podio::Frame` in the
following examples, this looks like this

```cpp
auto recos = edm4hep::ReconstructedParticleCollection();
event.put(std::move(recos), "ReconstructedParticles");
```

Note the requirement to explicitly use `std::move` in this case. At this point
`recos` is *moved* into the `event`, and you are left with an object [*in a
valid but unspecified state*](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12095473) that you
should under normal circumstances no longer use after this point. (Technically
we do enough that you still can use this, but don't expect the results to match
your expectations).

## Reading EDM4hep files
EDM4hep files are read with tools provided by podio:

- `ROOTFrameReader` - The default reader for files produced recently
- `ROOTLegacyReader` - The legacy reader for files produced in the past

(There is also a `ROOTReader` that is obsolete and will be deprecated soon, so
please don't use that). The main reason for two different readers is the
introduction of the Frame concept which is not yet fully complete so currently
things are in a sort of "hybrid state". See
[here](#how-do-i-figure-out-if-a-file-is-legacy) for more information on how to
figure out whether the file you are interested in is a legacy file or not.

As podio is a rather low level tool, also the interface of these readers feel
somewhat low level. This is mostly visible in the fact, that you have to provide
a `category` (name) when getting the number of entries, or when reading the next
entry. This is because in principle podio can handle multiple different
categories of Frames in one file. **For the purpose of this tutorial and also
for the majority of use cases, simply use `"events"` as category name.** Readers
in podio do not return a `podio::Frame` directly, rather they just return some
*frame data* from which a `podio::Frame` can be constructed. Putting all of
these things together, a simple event loop looks like this in c++:

```cpp
#include "podio/ROOTFrameReader.h"
#include "podio/ROOTLegacyReader.h" // For reading legacy files
#include "podio/Frame.h"

#include "edm4hep/MCParticleCollection.h"

int main() {
  auto reader = podio::ROOTFrameReader();
  // auto reader = podio::ROOTLegacyReader(); // For reading legacy files
  reader.openFile("some_file_containing_edm4hep_data.root");
  
  // Loop over all events
  for (size_t i = 0; i < reader.getEntries("events"); ++i) {
    auto event = podio::Frame(reader.readNextEntry("events"));
    auto& mcParticles = event.get<edm4hep::MCParticleCollection>("MCParticles");
    
    // do more stuff with this event
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The equivalent python code looks like this

```python
from podio import root_io

reader = root_io.Reader("some_file_containing_edm4hep_data.root")
# if you want to read legacy files use root_io.LegacyReader

for event in reader.get("events"):
  mcParticles = event.get("MCParticles")
  # do more stuff with this event
```

## ROOT file layout of podio generated EDMs
podio generated EDMs, i.e. also EDM4hep, use ROOT as their default I/O backend.
Since everything is based on PODs, the produced root files are pretty straight
forward to read and interpret (with some caveats). They are already almost flat
ntuples.

### How do I figure out if a file is legacy?

1. Use [`podio-dump`](#podio-dump) and it will tell you
```console
$podio-dump /home/workarea/data/rv02-02.sv02-02.mILD_l5_o1_v02.E250-SetA.I402003.Pe2e2h.eL.pR.n000.d_dstm_15089_0_edm4hep.root
input file: /home/workarea/data/rv02-02.sv02-02.mILD_l5_o1_v02.E250-SetA.I402003.Pe2e2h.eL.pR.n000.d_dstm_15089_0_edm4hep.root

Frame categories in this file (this is a legacy file!):
[...]
```

2. Peek inside the root file and look at the contents

![]()<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/key4hep/key4hep-tutorials/4b0cb1387169538c3580ab953c7bb179e42a8470/edm4hep_analysis/images/initial_browser_edm4hep.png" width="200"> ![]()<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/key4hep/key4hep-tutorials/4b0cb1387169538c3580ab953c7bb179e42a8470/edm4hep_analysis/images/initial_browser_legacy_edm4hep.png" width="200">


## `podio-dump`
The `podio-dump` utility allows to inspect EDM4hep files from the command line.
The synopsis looks like this

``` console
$podio-dump --help
usage: podio-dump [-h] [-c CATEGORY] [-e ENTRIES] [-d] inputfile

Dump contents of a podio file to stdout

positional arguments:
  inputfile             Name of the file to dump content from

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CATEGORY, --category CATEGORY
                        Which Frame category to dump
  -e ENTRIES, --entries ENTRIES
                        Which entries to print. A single number, comma separated list of numbers or "first:last" for an inclusive range of entries. Defaults to the first entry.
  -d, --detailed        Dump the full contents not just the collection info
```

By default it prints how many events are present in the file and also a summary
of the contents of the first event. This overview consists of the names, data
types and number of elements of the collections that are stored in this event.
Using the `--detailed` flag, `podio-dump` will print the complete contents of
all collections in ASCII format. This can be quite a bit of information. Using
the `--entries` flag it is possible to choose which events to look at. The
`--categories` flag is an advanced feature and not necessary for this tutorial.

`podio-dump` will also tell you whether the file that is passed to it is a
*legacy file* in which case you will need the `ROOTLegacyReader` or the
`SIOLegacyReader` to read it.
