# Getting started with Key4hep software

## Setting up the Key4hep Software Stack

### Using a central installation on cvmfs

Two builds with the key4hep stack are distributed on cvmfs. The releases happen
every few months on demand (for example, if there is a new important feature or
a breaking change) and at the moment Ubuntu22.04 and AlmaLinux9 (EL9,
RockyLinux9) are supported. We also have older releases for CentOS7 but are not
making any new builds for that.

```bash
source /cvmfs/sw.hsf.org/key4hep/setup.sh
```

In addition, nightly builds for AlmaLinux 9 and Ubuntu 22.04 with the latest
version of most of the packages are available:

```bash
source /cvmfs/sw-nightlies.hsf.org/key4hep/setup.sh
```

The `setup.sh` script always points to the latest build and it will change
without warning. However, after sourcing the script some information will be
displayed with instructions on how to reproduce the current environment.
**Nightly builds are intended for development and testing and they will be
deleted after some time from `/cvmfs`. They will also introduce new features
unannounced, so don't use these for anything else than development!**
